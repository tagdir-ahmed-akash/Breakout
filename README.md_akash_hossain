README for Brick Breaker Game
Introduction
Welcome to the Brick Breaker Game, a classic arcade-style project designed using C++ and the graphics.h library. This game offers an exciting and interactive experience where players can enjoy bouncing balls off a paddle to break colorful bricks. It combines elements of skill and strategy, providing an engaging challenge that harks back to traditional arcade games.

Game Overview
The Brick Breaker Game involves controlling a board positioned at the bottom of the screen, with the primary objective of preventing balls from falling off while simultaneously aiming to break as many bricks as possible.
